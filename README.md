The data is divided into six files. Appendix 1 is the original analysis reports, Appendix 2 is the output result based on the QWen model, and Appendix 3 is the output result based on the Ft-QWen model. Appendix 4 is based on the output of the Llama2 model, Appendix 5 is based on the output of the Ft-Llama2 model, and Appendix 6 is based on GPT-4o for detailed statistics of report scores.

Note: Since the original data in Appendix 1 contains images, the file is large, so the uploaded data does not contain image information.
